ref:
within a component itself, to interact with the react element, we use 'ref object'
also, to access the child component from parent component we can use 'ref object'
NOTE: both child and parent should be class component, or at least the child component should be a class component
what if the child component is a functional component????
use 'ref forwarding' mechanism
